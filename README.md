Things to know
--------------
There is a bug in ReSharper8 that prevents correct plugins initialization. (http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RSRP-382976)
Currently one possbile workaround is to open VS and then open solution. This is going to be fixed in next R# build.

ForTea is only a ReSharper plugin at the moment, and doesn't provide any Visual Studio service,
meaning there are some limitations.
Amongst those, syntax highlighting is fully handled by ReSharper rather than Visual Studio:
to get coloring for identifiers, you must enable _Color identifiers_ in _ReSharper Options > Code Inspection > Settings_.
Plus, there is no code outlining support yet.

Concerning ReSharper support, a custom code formatter for T4 files hasn't been written yet.
You can use code cleanup on .tt files and the C# formatting rules configured in ReSharper options
will be used automatically. However, there is currently no way to overwrite them, and there are no
rules for T4 specific elements, such as placement of opening and closing blocks.

Visual Basic T4 files aren't supported yet.  
Custom T4 directives aren't supported yet.  
File structure is read-only.  
If you have the T4 editor from Tangible, you must uninstall it. For technical reasons, ForTea will never be compatible with it.
